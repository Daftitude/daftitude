        <h1>About DaFTitude</h1>

        <p>
          <strong>DaFTitude</strong> stands for <strong>Data, Analytics, Finance, and Technology</strong> — but it’s also a mindset. Born from years of real-world experience, military discipline, deep tech obsession, and relentless problem-solving, DaFTitude is more than a brand — it's a movement.
        </p>

        <h2>👤 Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          I’m <strong>Kyhl B. Hines</strong> — a veteran, full-stack software engineer, crypto analyst, gamer, skater, and creator. I’ve walked the road of discipline and chaos, from combat boots to codebases. I started DaFTitude because I saw how unprepared most people are for the digital future — and I couldn’t unsee it.
        </p>

        <h2>🎯 The Mission</h2>
        <p>
          To empower individuals and families to protect themselves in a world driven by surveillance capitalism, misinformation, and decentralized tools they don’t understand. I build tools, write truth, and teach transparency — so others don’t have to learn it the hard way like I did.
        </p>

        <h2>⚙️ What We're Building</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>🔐 Crypto Transparency:</strong> A live mirror of my own wallet history. Win or lose — it's all visible.</li>
          <li><strong>📊 DaFT Family Dashboard:</strong> A token-based platform to gamify trust, habits, and communication for families.</li>
          <li><strong>📚 Tech Hub:</strong> Tutorials, reviews, and breakdowns on AI, hardware, software, and privacy tools.</li>
          <li><strong>🧠 AI & Security Tools:</strong> Custom tools for learning, managing data, and avoiding scams.</li>
          <li><strong>🎙️ Podcast & Videos:</strong> The raw, uncensored truth about money, tech, and mental health in a digital world.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>💬 From Me to You</h2>
        <blockquote>
          "This isn’t a side hustle. It’s my life mission. I lost time, energy, and money learning everything I now give away for free. If you’re here, you’re already part of the shift."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>🚀 What’s Coming</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Public Trust Pools backed by on-chain transparency</li>
          <li>Full open-source family token economy (KD, KDM, etc.)</li>
          <li>Jarvis-style AI Assistant OS for real-time utility and learning</li>
          <li>Community events, IRL meetups, and free tools for vets, parents, and youth</li>
        </ul>
