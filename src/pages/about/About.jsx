            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hi, I'm Kyhl Hines, the founder and CEO of DaFTitude. With over a decade of experience in IT,
              network engineering, and smart tech solutions, I've dedicated my career to making technology simple,
              accessible, and effective for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey began in the military, where I managed complex IT systems within high-stakes environments.
              From handling secure networks to developing efficient workflows, I learned the importance of precision,
              adaptability, and resilience. These experiences laid the foundation for DaFTitude â€” a company built to
              demystify technology and help people embrace it confidently.
